# College Science Museum

A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Simple rundown:
This is a Semester project with the theme of a science museum. It's buildt before JS was introduced and kept out of JS hands. 
Everything on the page is HTML and CSS - with some funky solutions. 

In more depth: 
  This is a page all about the museum - and what it offers. Everything from tours -guides and more. 
  There are checkouts made purely in CSS - and even though its not functional it was a fun CSS challenge. 
  Checkbox hack can be so powerful.I hope the design might inspire the ones exploring to build something out of the box.
